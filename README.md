A game of a retro space shooter

This is going to be a simple game that involves a spaceship that needs to avoid obstacles, shoot down enemies and to achieve a certain goal. 

I want to put an emphasis on controllability, so it is fun to maneuver and target. 
First option to try: 
Arrows V and ^ to accelerate and decelerate
Arrows < > to turn
A and D to shift the rocket right and left
R - drop ammunition
F - drop fuel
Fuel is important, and maneuver requires fuel.
Physics - 
The mass of the ship consists of (percents might change): 
Base mass (30%)
Ammunition (40%)
Fuel (30%) 
This will dictate top speed and acceleration, and minimum speed and acceleration. Also, mass affects fuel consumption. 
Shield
The ship will have an energy shield that can protect the ship from clashes
Item drop offs
Fuel (should drop more frequently when lower on fuel)
Ammunition (should drop more frequently when lower on ammunition)
Shield restoration
Enemies
Rocks floating around that must be avoided
A storm of small stones that must go around
Enemy spaceships that attack you
Enemy boss
Bonuses
Faster ammunition round
