A game of a retro space shooter

This is going to be a simple game that involves a spaceship that needs to avoid obstacles, shoot down enemies and to achieve a certain goal.

I want to put an emphasis on controllability, so it is fun to maneuver and target.
1. First option to try:
	* Arrows V and ^ to accelerate and decelerate
	* Arrows < > to turn
	* A and D to shift the rocket right and left
	* R - drop ammunition
	* F - drop fuel
* Fuel is important, and maneuver requires fuel.
2. Physics - This will dictate top speed and acceleration, and minimum speed and acceleration. Also, mass affects fuel consumption.
	* The mass of the ship consists of (percents might change):
	* Base mass (30%)
	* Ammunition (40%)
	* Fuel (30%)
3. Shield - The ship will have an energy shield that can protect the ship from clashes
4. Item drop offs
	* Fuel (should drop more frequently when lower on fuel)
	* Ammunition (should drop more frequently when lower on ammunition)
	* Shield restoration
5. Enemies
	* Rocks floating around that must be avoided
	* A storm of small stones that must go around
	* Enemy spaceships that attack you
	* Enemy boss
6. Bonuses
	* Faster ammunition round
